					<p> <strong>Hotpot! </strong>  Yummy, yummy, hotpot. This is my favorite go-to dish for those busy days. I love that you can toss it in a crock pot in the morning and when you come home you can finish off and have a yummy meal. While it is time consuming, it is not work. The time is all passive, mostly just cooking the pork as a slow braise. And, I see a lot of crock pot meals coming up in my life soon!</p>

					<p>I first found this recipe in <a href="https://www.rivercottage.net/"> <em>The River Cottage Cookbook</em> <a> by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. Hugh's is known for his back-to-basics cooking style with local and sustainable products.  As a locavore, this farm-to-table style of cooking is near and dear to my heart.  Food just tastes so much better when you know where it is from and that it is fresh. I know my pork is pasture raised, they had a good life and that good life actually makes them tastier is just a bonus for me. *grin* </p>

					<p>Originally from Mongolia, Mongol horsemen brought the concept through out Asia and each ethnicity adapted the hotpot to their own version. Hotpot is also known as: Sukiyaki (Japan), Shabu-shabu (Japan and Taiwan), Thai suki (Thailand), etc. Basically a stew with protein and vegetables which is spooned over noodles or rice. You can make it your own by swapping out the pork for beef or chicken or tofu (but then you don't need to braise it). This might be hard to make vegan or vegetarian but I'm sure that Google will help you with a vegetarian hotpot as I'm not sure how many additional spices you would need to create the Umami that the pork belly provides.</p>

		<h3>Directions</h3>
		<ol class="isSelectable">

			<li>Remove bones from the pork belly and cut into rectangular chunks, about 2.5 x 5 cm</li>

			<li>Remove the pork with a slotted spoon and set aside. Strain the braising liquid.</li>

		<h4>Notes:</h4>	
		<p>Tamari is a wheat-free alternative for soy sauce.</p>
		<p>Optional vegetables, can be almost anything. Just make sure to only select one or two options and slice thinly so as not to over power the dish. You really want the pork to be the main event.</p>
		<p>Crockpot directions: follow above directions on stove until step 5. Once stock has come to boil, put all the ingredients into the crock pot and place on low.  Make sure to cut the pork so that the braising time in the crock pot does not disintegrate the pork.  So, the longer you plan for it to be in the crockpot, the larger the size of the pork pieces.</p>
